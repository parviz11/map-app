# map-app
Example Plotly Dash app
This is a Plotly Dash app that views points on a map. The points can be anything that is identified by geographical coordinates (latitude, longitude). In this specific example, I am showing customers of a hypothetical company. 

*Functionalities* <br><br>
**Main map** <br>
Users can filter:
* Countries
* Partners
* Products

Hover data shows:
* Partner
* Product
* Gender

**Additonal graphs** <br>
Graphs on the right hand side of the page show the distribution of the population age and income. These graphs are based on the mouse hovering over the points on the map. The graphs show the distributions for the country based on the current placing of the mouse.
